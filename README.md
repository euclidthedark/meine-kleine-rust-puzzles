# Meine Kleine Rust Puzzles

Just messing around, solving little puzzles in Rust to learn the language.

### 2 number sum with hash map

*Challenge*

When given a sequence of `i32` values, find the 2 numbers, that when added together, will equal the sum given to the function and return
them as their own sorted `ASC` collection.

###### Example:

*Input* ([3, -4, 4, 1, 89, 10001, 3], -16)
*Output ->* [4, 4]


### 2 number sum with pointers

*Challenge*

When given a sequence of `i32` values, find the 2 numbers, that when added together, will equal the sum given to the function and return
them as their own sorted `ASC` collection.

###### Example:

*Input* ([3, -4, 4, 1, 89, 10001, 3], -5)
*Output ->* [1, 4]
